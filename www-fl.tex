\title{FriendlyLocation: Using Tie Strength to Improve Location Estimation}

\maketitle
\begin{abstract}

With the rise of volunteered user location information through services
like Foursquare, Google Latitude, and Facebook Places, we face unprecedented
access to the real-world connections among millions of social media users.
%
This location information is increasingly incorporated into social media for
providing localized content, location-aware recommendations, and other
geo-spatial enabled services.
%
In this paper, we investigate the relationship between the strength of the tie
between a pair of users, and the distance between the pair through an
examination of over 100 million geo-encoded tweets and
over 73 million user profiles collected from Twitter.
%
Based on this investigation, we identify several factors such as number of
followers and how the users interact that can strongly reveal the distance
between a pair of users, and use these factors to train a tree classifier to
predict the distance between a pair of connected users.
%
We use the results of this classifier as the input to a maximum likelihood
estimator to predict a user's location.
%
We find that this proposed method significantly improves the results of
location estimation relative to a state-of-the-art technique.
