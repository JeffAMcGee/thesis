\indent With the rise of volunteered user location information through services
like Foursquare, Google Latitude, and Facebook Places, we face unprecedented
access to the real-world connections among millions of social media users. This
location information is increasingly incorporated into social media for
providing localized content, location-aware recommendations, and other
geo-spatial enabled services.
In this paper, we investigate the interplay of
distance and tie strength through an examination of 20 million geo-encoded
tweets collected from Twitter and 6 million user profiles. Concretely, we
investigate the relationship between the strength of the tie between a pair of
users, and the distance between the pair. We identify several factors --
including following, mentioning, and actively engaging in conversations with
another user -- that can strongly reveal the distance between a pair of users.
We find a bimodal distribution in Twitter, with one peak around 10 miles from
people who live nearby, and another peak around 2500 miles, further validating
Twitter's use as both a social network (with geographically nearby friends) and
as a news distribution network (with very distant relationships).
Based on these findings, we propose and evaluate a method for predicting
location for users based purely on an analysis of the user's social network,
which has great significance for augmenting traditional social media and
enriching location-based services with more refined and accurate location
estimates.
