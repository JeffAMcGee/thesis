\indent We propose a novel network-based approach for location estimation in social
media that integrates evidence of the \textit{social tie strength} between
users for improved location estimation.
%
Concretely, we propose a location
estimator -- FriendlyLocation -- that leverages the relationship between the
strength of the tie between a pair of users, and the distance between the pair.
%
Based on an examination of over 100 million geo-encoded tweets and 73 million
Twitter user profiles, we identify several factors such as the
number of followers and how the users interact that can strongly reveal the
distance between a pair of users.
%
We use these factors to train a decision
tree to distinguish between pairs of users who are likely to live nearby and pairs of
users who are likely to live in different areas.
%
We use the results of this decision tree as the input to a maximum likelihood
estimator to predict a user's location.
We find that this proposed method significantly improves the results of
location estimation relative to a state-of-the-art technique.
Our system reduces the average error distance for 80\% of Twitter users from 40
miles to 21 miles using only information from the user's friends and
friends-of-friends,  which has great significance for augmenting traditional
social media and enriching location-based services with more refined and
accurate location estimates.
